# Low-Light-image-Enhancement
1.) Developed a model to improve illumination in low light images using illumination map estimation
2.) Constructed initial illumination map, refined it using anAugmented Lagrangian Multiplier based algorithm
3.) Estimated light enhanced images by pixel-wise division of original image and refined illumination map
