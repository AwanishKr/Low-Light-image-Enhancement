# Low-Light-image-Enhancement
Developed a model to improve illumination in low light images using illumination map estimation
Constructed initial illumination map, refined it using anAugmented Lagrangian Multiplier based algorithm
Estimated light enhanced images by pixel-wise division of original image and refined illumination map
